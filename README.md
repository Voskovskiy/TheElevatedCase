# TheElevatedCase

Simple console application written in **Kotlin**.

**Task:**
We have a building with random number of flours (2-100 by default). You have an elevator with random capacity(2-100) and random number of people around.
The idea is to delvier people to the destonation flour as faster as possible.

* **_startingFlour** : Starting flour, do not confuse with Array Index(let the code do the work)
* **_minRandom** : Minimal Int for the Randomizer method ranDom (Int, Int) -> Int
* **_maxRandom** : Maximum value for the Randomizer
* **_elevatorCapacity** : This is how we get the elevator sized
* **_buildingSize** : Same with the quantity of the flour of the generated building
